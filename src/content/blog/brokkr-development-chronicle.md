*"Many hammers. One forge."*

A self-hosted Remote-Execution-API grid, built solo and in the open with Claude Code as a standing pair, one gated phase at a time. This is the story of how it got from an empty Cargo workspace to a fault-tolerant, multi-tenant compute cluster — told through the project's own planning docs, ADRs, and phase journals.

- **Language:** Rust, edition 2021, MSRV 1.85
- **Crates:** 9
- **Current phase:** 4 (wrap-up) → 5 (planned)
- **License:** Apache-2.0

| Phase | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Bootstrap | done |
| 1 | First End-to-End Slice | done |
| 2 | Hermetic Sandboxing | done |
| 3 | Distributed Cache | done |
| 4 | Scheduler & Multi-Tenancy | wrap-up (one tracked gap) |
| 5 | Consensus & HA (Raft) | planned, not started |

## Why it exists

Brokkr turns a fleet of Linux machines into one coherent grid for builds, tests, and batch compute — speaking Bazel's Remote Execution API (REAPI) so existing tooling can point at it without a rewrite. It exists for two stated reasons: CI is slow and expensive everywhere, and building a REAPI server, a content-addressed cache, a sandbox, a scheduler, and eventually a Raft implementation is, in the founder's own words, "the most educational distributed-systems project I can attempt."

The project's axioms were fixed before a line of code existed, and they still show up in every phase journal: determinism is sacred, correctness beats performance beats convenience, and every sandbox layer assumes the layer above it is hostile. The codebase is plain — `WorkerId`, `JobId`, `Digest` as newtypes, `bytes::Bytes` for blobs, `thiserror` enums everywhere — but the roadmap is ambitious: hermetic sandboxing on raw Linux primitives (no Docker, ever), a hand-rolled bloom filter and rendezvous-hash ring for the cache, and a from-scratch Raft implementation waiting in Phase 5.

---

## The operating model

What makes Brokkr's development process worth writing up isn't any single technical choice — it's the discipline wrapped around them. Two documents anchor everything: `docs/plan.md`, a ~1,200-line source of truth covering architecture, the six-phase roadmap, and exit criteria per phase; and `CLAUDE.md`, a condensed operating manual read by the AI on every session. Ten hard rules in that file — no `unwrap()` in library code, no `unsafe` without a `// SAFETY:` comment, no Docker in the sandbox crate, no imported Raft crate — are treated as non-negotiable, and the journals show them being enforced against real temptation, not just stated as policy.

Each phase is scoped into small milestones (Phase 2's M1–M9, Phase 4's I1–I19), and the convention is strict: **one milestone, one PR, one journal entry.** The entry records what shipped, the decisions taken and why, and a "what surprised me" section — which turns out to be where the most valuable engineering knowledge in the whole project lives. Phases don't end until an exit-criteria review is written up honestly, gaps and all — Phase 4's wrap-up flags a missed Bazel-compatibility demonstration rather than quietly dropping it.

> **From CLAUDE.md:** *"If the user proposes an architectural change that conflicts with `docs/plan.md`, flag the conflict and ask whether to update the plan."*
>
> Phase 4 alone shows this rule firing repeatedly — dispatch model (ADR 0008), lease design (ADR 0009), tenancy (ADR 0010), and auth (ADR 0011) were all stopped-and-asked before implementation, not decided unilaterally mid-flight.

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap
*2026-04-28 · 9 crates · MSRV 1.78 → 1.85 · ADR 0001*

The goal was deliberately unglamorous: a Cargo workspace that builds, a `brokk version` binary, and green CI on Linux x86_64 and aarch64. Nine crates were laid out as a strict dependency DAG with `brokkr-common` as the only universal dependency — a shape that held for the rest of the project without a single exception needed.

Two early surprises set the tone for how the project would handle friction: the MSRV had to jump from 1.78 to 1.85 mid-bootstrap because a transitive dependency of Tonic required edition 2024, and the vendored REAPI protobufs needed their module hierarchy mirrored exactly (`build::bazel::remote::execution::v2`) because Prost's generated `super::super::…` paths don't tolerate a flattened module tree. Both fixes are one paragraph in the journal; neither derailed the phase.

---

## Phase 1 — First End-to-End Slice

Phase 1 threaded the thinnest possible path through every architectural layer: an in-memory then on-disk CAS, a redb-backed action cache, a single-worker scheduler, and a `brokk run -- echo hello` command that actually round-trips through gRPC and hits the action cache on the second call. Nothing here is fast or distributed yet — the worker runs jobs as a bare `tokio::process::Command`, exactly as `CLAUDE.md`'s phase-awareness rule says it should at this stage — but the wire protocol, the digest verification, and the tracing spans on the hot path (`client::execute` → `control::dispatch` → `worker::run_action`) are the real thing, not stubs.

---

## Phase 2 — Hermetic Sandboxing
*M1–M9 · 2026-04-30 → 2026-05-14*

This is where Brokkr stops being a REAPI toy and starts being a systems project. The goal: a worker executes actions inside a real Linux sandbox, built layer by layer with no Docker, runc, or containerd anywhere near it — a hard rule, not a preference. Each of the nine milestones added one isolation primitive, and each one earned at least one genuinely hard-won lesson.

| M# | Layer added | What it proved |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | Host compatibility probes | Cross-distro kernel checks (WSL2's version string parses differently from stock Linux) |
| M2 | Re-exec runner skeleton | Phase-1 parity inside a new process model, via a JSON config pipe on fd 3 |
| M3 | Mount namespace + pivot_root | Sandboxed process cannot see `/etc/shadow` or the host mount tree |
| M4 | PID namespace + init reaper | Sandboxed process is PID 1; orphans are reaped, not leaked |
| M5 | Network namespace | No network by default, opt-in loopback only, proven via raw errno |
| M6 | cgroups v2 | Memory/CPU/PID limits; OOM and fork bombs are contained, not merely logged |
| M7 | seccomp-bpf + capability drop | Default-deny syscall filter; five new "evil action" tests pass |
| M8 | Determinism policy | Fixed hostname, forced UTC, scrubbed `LD_PRELOAD` — byte-identical reruns |
| M9 | Worker integration | Sandbox is the worker's default runner; `--no-sandbox` is the escape hatch |

> **Field note · M2:** `pipe2(O_CLOEXEC)` turned out to be load-bearing. Without it, the runner inherited a copy of its own pipe write-end through `fork`, so `read_to_end(fd 3)` on the host never saw EOF and the whole thing deadlocked. Roughly fourteen minutes were spent staring at a hung `brokkr-sandboxd` before the missing flag was found.

> **Field note · M7:** Capability dropping has exactly one legal order: Effective, then Permitted, then Inheritable. `capset(2)` revalidates the whole vector on every call and rejects any state where the new Effective isn't a subset of the new Permitted — dropping Inheritable first (the "obvious" order) fails immediately with an unhelpful `EPERM`. The seccomp mismatch action was also deliberately set to `EPERM` rather than a killing `SIGSYS`, on the theory that a debuggable errno trail is worth more to a build sandbox than a marginally stronger instant-kill guarantee.

By M9, every "evil action" test in the matrix passes: reading host secrets, mounting filesystems, fork-bombing, allocating past the memory cap, resolving DNS, and reading the CPU timestamp counter are all denied at the layer built to deny them.

---

## Phase 3 — Distributed Cache
*M0–M7 · 2026-05-14 → 2026-05-17*

Phase 3 took the single-node CAS from Phase 1 and made it a cluster: rendezvous (HRW) hashing for replica placement, quorum writes with async peer repair, a hand-rolled bloom filter to short-circuit `FindMissingBlobs`, a byte-bounded LRU hot tier, and — the centerpiece — a FUSE filesystem that lazily materializes multi-gigabyte input trees without copying bytes the action never reads.

The recurring architectural move across this phase is the **decorator pattern**: `BloomCas<C>`, `TieredCas<W>`, and `ReplicatedCas<P>` all wrap any `Cas` implementation rather than modifying one directly, so a test that wants a bare `RedbCas` keeps having exactly that, and every layer composes independently. It's also, by the project's own count, one of the cheaper phases dependency-wise — the bloom filter and the LRU are both hand-rolled rather than imported, on the reasoning that each was genuinely a couple hundred lines of arithmetic, cheaper to write than to audit a crate for.

> **Field note · M6b:** Unmounting a FUSE filesystem correctly took three attempts to get right. `BackgroundSession::join()` alone hangs forever, because fuser's background loop only exits once its `/dev/fuse` descriptor is closed by the unmount — which is exactly the step that `join()` is waiting to happen. The fix, `umount_and_join()`, explicitly unmounts before joining, wrapped in a 5-second timeout with a `fusermount -uz` lazy-detach fallback for when the kernel is still mid-`read`.

**Phase 3 in numbers:** 8 milestones shipped (M6 split into a/b) · ~4k lines of new code + tests · zero existing tests broken across Phases 1–2 · 3 new external deps (`fuser`, `memmap2`, `rand` dev-only).

The phase closed with a three-node soak test churning one node in and out every `N` operations, asserting zero data loss and sub-second reconvergence — with the OpenDAL-backed cold storage tier and the `brokk admin gc` CLI explicitly named and deferred to Phase 4, rather than silently dropped.

---

## Phase 4 — Scheduler & Multi-Tenancy
*I1–I19 · PRs #98–#116 · started 2026-06-27*

Phase 4 is where Brokkr stopped being a single-worker demo and became a cluster that can lose a machine mid-job and keep going. It's also the phase with the clearest example of the project's incremental discipline: nineteen numbered increments, each landing a thin, fully-tested slice, several of them explicitly split into a "foundation" PR (pure data structures, unit-tested in isolation) followed by a "wiring" PR (the riskier integration).

**The chain, increment by increment:**

- **I1–I4** — a worker registry with injected-clock heartbeat eviction, closing with an end-to-end liveness loop.
- **I5–I7** — REAPI platform-constraint matching, wired into the scheduler as admission control, then into the worker as capability advertisement.
- **I8–I10** — the multi-worker dispatch redesign (ADR 0008): per-worker queues with submit-time routing, plus `SimpleFifo` and `BinPacking` strategies.
- **I11–I14** — job leases with crash reassignment (ADR 0009): a global pending queue, an expiry reaper, and — the cleanest fix of the whole phase — tying lease renewal to the existing heartbeat, so a lease only expires when a worker is actually dead.
- **I15–I17** — tenants and fair scheduling (ADR 0010): a Start-time Fair Queue with per-tenant virtual clocks, then per-tenant concurrency quotas.
- **I18–I19** — client authentication (ADR 0011): JWT bearer tokens with an authoritative tenant claim, plus worker↔control mTLS.

> **Field note · I14:** Tying lease renewal to the worker's existing heartbeat — instead of adding a dedicated renewal RPC — turned out to dissolve an entire earlier problem rather than patch it. Once a live worker's lease renews every heartbeat, it can never be wrongly re-picked as "expired," and a genuinely dead worker's lease decays exactly when its heartbeat stops. Lease lifetime became a synonym for worker liveness, with zero new wire surface.

> **Field note · Phase 4 wrap-up:** Introducing capacity-1 leases (one job per worker at a time) quietly made the `BinPacking` strategy behave identically to `SimpleFifo` — every candidate worker is either idle or excluded, so there's no load differential left to pack against. Rather than paper over it, the team wrote a test that pins the degradation as deliberate, and left a per-worker-capacity knob as the documented way to bring packing back.

The phase met two of its three defined success criteria outright: two tenants sharing one worker measurably interleave rather than one starving the other, and a worker killed mid-job has its work reassigned and completed elsewhere. The third — a real `bazel build` running against Brokkr as its remote executor — was assessed as infeasible in the WSL2, Bazel-less development environment and recorded as a tracked gap rather than quietly skipped, per the project's own rule about honest exit-criteria reviews.

---

## Phase 5 — Consensus & HA
*Planned, not yet started*

No Raft code exists yet, but the phase already has a complete, self-contained execution plan — eleven milestones (I0–I10), a full pitfall codex of eleven named failure modes drawn from the paper and from other implementations' post-mortems, and one architectural decision already made before day one: the Raft state machine will be a **sans-IO core** — pure, single-threaded, and blind to clocks, threads, and sockets.

The reasoning, laid out in advance: the phase's definition of done requires a million operations under fault injection with zero divergence, and that's only checkable if the protocol itself can be driven by a seeded, deterministic loop — no `tokio`, no sleeps, no flakes. A thin "shell" around the core will own the actual clock ticks and gRPC transport; the hard bugs are expected to live entirely in the deterministic core, where they're reproducible by construction. `turmoil` — Tokio's deterministic network simulator — is the one new dependency pre-approved for the whole phase; everything else, including any temptation to reach for `raft-rs` or `openraft`, requires stopping and asking first.

---

## What repeats across every phase

- **Injected clocks, never `Instant::now()` in logic.** Every time-sensitive method — worker eviction, lease expiry, fair-queue tagging — takes an explicit `now` parameter, so eviction-boundary tests pin a moment and add durations instead of sleeping.
- **Foundation, then wiring, as separate PRs.** Pure data structures (a `LeaseTable`, a `FairQueue`, a `Strategy` trait) land fully unit-tested before the riskier integration touches live dispatch code.
- **Decorators over rewrites.** New CAS capabilities wrap the existing trait rather than modifying it, so nothing upstream has to change to gain a bloom filter or an LRU tier.
- **ADRs precede forks, not follow them.** Multi-worker dispatch, leases, tenancy, and auth were each written up as an ADR and checked with the owner before implementation started, not rationalized after the fact.
- **WSL2 as a partial oracle.** The dev host can't run the full sandbox test suite (seccomp argument-filter tests need a real kernel), so verification is per-crate locally with Linux CI as the backstop — and a past stale-branch mistake (PR #96) is carried forward as a standing reminder to check `origin/main`, not just the working tree.
- **The "what surprised me" section is not optional.** Nearly every milestone entry ends with one, and they're where the sharpest, most specific engineering lessons in the whole project actually live — a discipline that turns each PR into a small, searchable case study rather than just a diff.

## What's next

Phase 4 is complete against its own definition of done except for the tracked Bazel-compatibility gap, which is now an explicit owner decision rather than an oversight. In parallel, an operator TUI — a read-only terminal console for live cluster, job, and cache state — has been pulled forward from Phase 6 under ADR 0012, on the reasoning that it's additive and read-mostly enough not to block the much larger undertaking waiting behind it.

That undertaking is Phase 5: replacing the embedded redb metadata store with a Raft implementation written from the paper, with no shortcuts. `CLAUDE.md` calls it out by name as the one rule that requires stopping and asking rather than improvising — which, six phases in, has been the project's actual operating principle all along.
